# Early-Stage-Diabetes-Risk-Prediction
The project **'Early-Stage-Diabetes-Risk-Prediction'** is developed for my workshop in **Iraqidata**, focusing on equipping participants with the knowledge and practical skills to predict the risk of early-stage diabetes. By delving into the realms of data analysis and predictive modeling, attendees will gain hands-on experience in leveraging data-driven approaches to assess and forecast the likelihood of diabetes onset. This initiative not only provides a platform for learning cutting-edge techniques in data science but also addresses a critical health concern, offering a tangible application of data analytics in healthcare. Participants will navigate through the intricacies of **feature selection**, **model building**, and **evaluation**, ultimately contributing to their proficiency in utilizing data for early-stage diabetes risk assessment.
